# Captain Veggie

## Description
Captain Veggie is an engaging game where players navigate Captain Veggie through a field to harvest vegetables before a group of ravenous rabbits can eat them. 
The field is a grid where each cell can either contain a vegetable, a rabbit, or the Captain. 
The goal is to move Captain Veggie around the field to collect vegetables, scoring points with each harvest while avoiding the rabbits that randomly hop around, consuming the vegetables.

## Gameplay
- The game is played on a grid representing the field.
- Captain Veggie, controlled by the player, can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right.
- Each move can result in either:
  - Harvesting a vegetable, if the Captain lands on a cell with a vegetable.
  - An empty move, if the cell is empty.
- Meanwhile, rabbits move randomly on the field, consuming any vegetables they land on.
- The game ends when all vegetables are harvested or eaten.

## Scoring
- Each vegetable harvested by Captain Veggie adds points to the player's score.
- Different vegetables may be worth different amounts of points.
- The final score is displayed once the game ends.
